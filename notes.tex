\section{1}%
Eliciting strong convexity. 
Check Theorem 5

$A$ linear with
\begin{equation}
  \left\langle x, Ax \right\rangle > 0, \quad \forall x \in S
\end{equation}
Then there exists an $e$ such that $A+P^{\perp}$ is strongly monotone

\subsection{}%
Have $A$ linear, otherwise arbitrary but all negative eigenvalues perpendicular to $S$. So actually problem is nonconvex but we elicit convexity
\begin{remark}
  What do we compare this algorithm to? Shouldn't every  algorithm solving this problem probject on $S$ and thus make use of convexity?
\end{remark}

good example on variational convexity. use this for some nonconvex regularizers? 
* $\lVert \cdot \rVert$_{p} for $p \in (0,1)$ probably won't work
* maybe cut-off 1 norm!
